## Welcome to Yu Zhang Lab!

We are thrilled to announce the official opening of the **Brain Atlas and Brain-Inspired AI Laboratory** at the School of Psychology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in September 2025.

### About the Lab

Led by **Prof. Yu Zhang**, a National High-Level Young Talent, our laboratory focuses on three main research directions:

1. **Brain Atlas Across the Lifespan**: Mapping brain development from infancy to aging
2. **Brain Atlas Big Data Analysis and Modeling**: Building foundation models for brain imaging
3. **Brain Science and AI Intersection**: Developing brain-constrained AI systems

### Our Mission

We aim to bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence by creating comprehensive brain atlases and developing brain-inspired AI models. Our research combines multimodal neuroimaging, computational modeling, and machine learning to understand brain organization and function.

### Join Us!

We are actively recruiting:
- **2-3 Postdoctoral Researchers**
- **3-5 Research Assistants** (including gap-year students and interns)

Interested candidates should send their CV and research statement to: **yuzhang2@sjtu.edu.cn**
