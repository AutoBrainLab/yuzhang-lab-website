# Welcome to Yu Zhang Lab

**Brain Atlas and Brain-Inspired AI Laboratory**  
*School of Psychology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University*

---

## üß† Our Mission

We are dedicated to mapping the human brain across the lifespan, building brain atlas big data platforms, and advancing brain-inspired artificial intelligence through the deep integration of neuroscience and AI.

---

## üî¨ Research Focus

Our lab focuses on three core research directions:

### 1. Brain Atlas Across the Lifespan
Combining multimodal brain imaging and connectomics to map fine functional parcellations of cortical and subcortical regions; quantifying spatiotemporal evolution patterns of brain structure and function through developmental, aging, and disease cohorts; constructing individualized brain network models to identify intervention targets.

### 2. Brain Atlas Big Data Analysis and Modeling
Building an integrated brain atlas big data platform, aggregating cross-modal and multi-scale brain atlas data, training "foundation models for neuroscience" to enable brain cognitive simulation and disease progression modeling.

### 3. Brain Science and AI Intersection
Using real brain atlas + connectivity + networks to constrain deep learning, constructing a "structure-function-behavior" closed-loop framework to decode language, memory, and decision-making mechanisms, providing explainable and evolvable architectures for artificial general intelligence.
